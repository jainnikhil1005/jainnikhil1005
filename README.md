### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with a minor in Statistics.  
I enjoy building systems that are **reliable, scalable, and impactful**—from full-stack apps that make daily life easier to infrastructure tools that support high-performance computing.  

I thrive on learning quickly, breaking down complex problems, and turning ideas into working solutions.
