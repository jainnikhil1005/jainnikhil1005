### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m **Nikhil Jain**, a Computer Science student at **Texas A&M University** with a **minor in Statistics**. I love solving problems at the intersection of **software, data, and systems**.  
- I’m especially interested in **infrastructure**, **machine learning applications**, and **full-stack product design**.  
- My projects and internships reflect a mix of **scale** (supercomputing nodes, cloud pipelines) and **impact** (apps that save people time, money, or improve healthcare).  
- I thrive in environments where I can **learn quickly, collaborate closely**, and **ship meaningful results**.  

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, working out, and watching way too many sports highlights.

### 💼 Experience
**Software Engineering Intern @ Hewlett Packard Enterprise**  
At HPE, I worked on Cray supercomputing systems:  
- Strengthened backend fault detection and improved stability for the **Slingshot Fabric Manager** (Java/Linux).  
- Built **Python/Ruby infrastructure-as-code pipelines** in HPE Performance Cluster Manager to automate rolling updates across **1,000+ nodes**, reducing downtime to nearly zero.  

**Research Intern @ New York University**  
At NYU’s Materials Lab, I applied machine learning and computer vision:  
- Developed a **CNN model with OpenCV + PyTorch** that improved detection accuracy of grain boundaries in 3D-printed materials by **18%**.  
- Presented research findings at the **SAMPE NJ Conference**, communicating technical work to a broader engineering audience.  

**Software Engineering Intern @ Crestron Electronics**  
At Crestron, I gained experience in cloud and DevOps:  
- Automated **Azure Redis** updates and maintenance, shrinking downtime by **60%**.  
- Integrated automation with DevOps pipelines (PowerShell, YAML) for **zero-downtime rolling updates** and data sync.

### 🛠️ Featured Projects
Here are some projects I’ve built and actively maintain:  

- **Medscope**  
  A prescription interaction checker using OCR + microservices.  
  - Returns “Safe” or “Warning” results in **under 12 seconds** with **91% accuracy**.  
  - Supports **300+ prescriptions in beta testing**, saving time and reducing manual cross-referencing for users.  

- **DealDish**  
  A grocery deal aggregator and recipe generator.  
  - Normalizes weekly supermarket data and cross-references with a recipe database.  
  - Helps users save **~20%** on groceries by building optimized shopping lists.  

- **Ipelint**  
  Patent approval predictor.  
  - Uses web scraping + ML to assess the likelihood of patent approvals.  
  - Early tests show strong predictive performance, making it a helpful tool for inventors and researchers.  

- **Trefos Network**  
  A food donation coordination platform.  
  - Links restaurants with food banks using AWS Amplify, DynamoDB, and React.  
  - Automates surplus food listings and reduces waste by streamlining the donation process.

### ⚡ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java, Python, C++, C, JavaScript, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Flask, FastAPI, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Material-UI  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, TravisCI, Git, VS Code  
- **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

I enjoy picking up new tools quickly and have used everything from **Kubernetes clusters** to **OCR pipelines** in real-world projects.

### 🏈 Outside of Tech
I’m a big believer in balance, so outside of school and engineering, you’ll find me:  
- Cheering for the **Dallas Cowboys 🏈**, **Dallas Mavericks 🏀**, and **Texas Rangers ⚾**  
- Playing pickup basketball, running, or hitting the gym  
- Traveling, trying new food spots, and spending time with friends and family  

Sports and coding may seem different, but both teach me about **discipline, teamwork, and resilience**.
